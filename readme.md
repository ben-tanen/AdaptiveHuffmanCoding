## A visual exploration of Adaptive Huffman Coding

This is a scroll-based walkthrough exploring and comparing [traditional Huffman Coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding) to [adaptive Huffman Coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_Huffman_coding). It serves as a tool to learn how the two algorithms work and is intended for anyone to view (not just CS majors).

This was done as a final project for Tufts' COMP-150: Advanced Data Structures and Algorithms (Spring 2017).

*Usability Note*: I have noticed some rendering issues when viewing the second half of the project in Safari and Firefox. As a result, I would suggest viewing the site in Chrome.

#### To Do

- [x] Fill in words for FGK explanation
- [x] Add FGK data for playground trees
- [x] Auto-render "bookkeeper" when entering playground
- [x] Add more text / description around playground
- [x] Make final rendering of FGK walkthrough tree to match playground tree
- [ ] Clean up code
- [ ] Highlight nodes that are being updated on FGK walkthrough
- [ ] Fix scrolling rendering for fast scrolling
